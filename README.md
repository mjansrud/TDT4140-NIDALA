NIDALA (NTNU Individually Dynamic Assigned Learning Assistant)

NIDALA is a project that aims to improve upon the many exercise programs on NTNU. <br />
Our idea of improvment is bade upon the concept of spaced repetition. <br />
Questions from previous excersices will show up on current excersices when NIDALA believes you need them repeated. <br />
If you stuggle with the same concepts over several assignments NIDALA will notify the teaching-staff, so they can help you <br />
